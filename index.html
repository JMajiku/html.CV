    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a recent IT graduate from the Vaal University of Technology with a
        major in computer science. I am eager<br /> to contribute my skills and
        knowledge to a dynamic team. During my studies, I developed strong
        proficiency in Python, <br />working on over 80 projects, and gained
        experience with web frameworks. I also have hands-on experience
        creating <br />websites with WordPress. My coursework and certifications in
        CCNA and IBM Cloud have given me a solid understanding<br /> of
        distributed technologies and cloud computing. Additionally, I am
        comfortable with relational databases, <br />SQL, and basic web
        development using HTML and CSS. Basically, I am good at anything
        tech-related. <br />I am enthusiastic about applying my skills in a
        professional setting.</p>
